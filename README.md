### Installation
- Clone this repository
- Install Pytorch: 
       > conda install PyTorch -c PyTorch    (using anaconda)
       > pip3 install torchvision
(if you can't install Pytorch follow the instructions on this link: http://deeplizard.com/learn/video/UWlFM0R_x6I)
- run Fashion_MNIST.ipynb

### Description
Classifying clothing images (28x28 gray scale images).
Once you run the Fashion_MNIST.ipynb the neural network will be trained and will test itself on a random image of the dataset. The output will be of the random image and the guesses along with their probability. 

### Files used
MNIST_data
helper.py
imported datasets, and transforms from torchvision

### Credits
This project was done during a Nanodegree for Udacity

### Skills learned
